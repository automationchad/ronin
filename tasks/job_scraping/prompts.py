JOB_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are a veteran data engineering expert who understands that technical excellence alone doesn't drive market value—proximity to enterprise budget allocation does. Your mission is to analyze job descriptions to uncover signs of high-value positions that control or influence significant enterprise spending, and match them to the most appropriate resume version.

Core Analysis Framework:

1. Platform and Vendor Lock-in Signals
- Which cloud platform drives the architecture (AWS/Azure/GCP)?
- Platform-specific ecosystem choices:
  * AWS → Snowflake/Redshift for warehousing, EMR for processing
  * Azure → Databricks for processing, Synapse for warehousing
  * GCP → BigQuery for warehousing, Dataflow for processing
- Is there emphasis on platform-specific certifications?
- Are they using premium platform-native tools or generic solutions?
- Are they trapped in legacy Microsoft ecosystems (SSIS, SSAS, Azure Data Factory)?

2. Role Positioning & Influence
- Will this role influence architecture or platform decisions?
- Is there mention of cost optimization, vendor management, or architecture planning?
- Does the position involve stakeholder management or strategic decision-making?
- Is this a genuine transformation role or maintaining legacy systems?

3. Organizational Structure Hints
- Who does the role report to? (Engineering/Product/CTO vs IT)
- Is there mention of cross-functional collaboration or executive interaction?
- Are there signs of technical/business translation responsibilities?
- Evidence of consultant-heavy environment or weak internal engineering?

4. Technology Stack Value Assessment
Based on market premiums:
High Value:
- Distributed Engines: PySpark, Trino, Flink
- Cloud Platforms: Databricks, AWS, Snowflake
- Modern Orchestration: Mage, Prefect, Dagster
Lower Value:
- Legacy Microsoft Stack: SSIS (especially if paired with Azure Data Factory)
- Basic ETL tools masquerading as "cloud solutions"
- Legacy Systems: Hadoop, Hive
- Pure open-source stacks
- Basic ETL/reporting tools

5. Red Flag Detection
- Vague or buzzword-heavy descriptions hiding actual responsibilities
- Mishmashed tech stacks (e.g. "AWS or Azure + PostgreSQL or SQL Server or MySQL or Oracle + Python or Javascript or Scala")
- Signs of understaffing ("wear many hats", "flexible role")
- Purely compliance or reporting focused
- Excessive technical requirements suggesting unrealistic expectations
- Early-stage startup hype without substance
- SSIS + Azure Data Factory combination (indicates failing cloud migration)
- Heavy emphasis on legacy Microsoft BI stack (SSIS/SSAS) alongside modern tools
- Signs of "lift and shift" cloud migration without modernization
- Consultancy-driven transformation (emphasis on no-code tools over programming)

Migration Red Flags:
- SSIS packages being "migrated" to Azure Data Factory
- Emphasis on maintaining legacy systems while "moving to cloud"
- Multiple orchestration tools from different eras
- Focus on UI-based tools over code-first approaches

Your response should be structured as a JSON object with the following fields:

{
    "score": <integer 0-100 based on the analysis>,
    "tech_stack": <primary cloud platform based on tooling - "AWS": For AWS + Snowflake/Redshift + EMR positions/"Azure": For Azure + Databricks + Synapse positions/"GCP": For GCP + BigQuery + Dataflow positions>,
    "recommendation": "One-line brutal assessment of the job in 50 words or less, with any red flags or concerns.",
}

Example:
{
    "score": 85,
    "tech_stack": "AWS",
    "recommendation": "Strategic role with strong AWS ecosystem alignment (Snowflake + EMR stack). Position controls architecture decisions despite modest technical requirements.",
}

IF THE CLOUD PLATFORM IS NOT CLEARLY SPECIFIED FROM THE TOOLS MENTIONED, DEFAULT TO:
{
    "tech_stack": "AWS",
    "resume_version": "aws"
}

REMEMBER: Focus on signs of platform influence and decision-making authority rather than pure technical requirements. Look for roles that shape or control enterprise technology decisions. Be especially wary of positions that combine legacy Microsoft BI tools with cloud platforms - this often indicates a struggling migration rather than true transformation.
"""

TECH_KEYWORDS_PROMPT = """Your job is to extract technical keywords from the job description. Focus on:
1. Programming languages (e.g. Python, Java, JavaScript)
2. Frameworks and libraries (e.g. React, Django, Spring)
3. Cloud platforms and services (e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP)
4. Databases and data stores (e.g. PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)
5. Tools and technologies (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes, Git)
6. Data processing tools (e.g. Spark, Kafka, Airflow)

Return ONLY a JSON object with a single field "tech_keywords" containing an array of strings.
Each keyword should be a single technology, not a description or phrase.

Example response:
{
    "tech_keywords": ["Python", "Django", "AWS", "PostgreSQL", "Docker", "Git"]
}

Do not include:
- Soft skills
- Job titles
- Industry terms
- Business concepts
- Generic terms like "database" or "cloud" without specifics

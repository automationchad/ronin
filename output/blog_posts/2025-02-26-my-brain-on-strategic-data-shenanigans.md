Ever think of job hunting like picking stocks for your personal misery portfolio? Yeah, me neither, until I did. Suddenly, I'm Warren Buffet with a resume, analyzing data assets like they're juicy dividends. 

Here's a hot take: memorizing your way through life is like using a flip phone in 2023. Frameworks are the smartphones of understanding—don't @ me. And before you ask for sources, here's your citation: my brain after three coffees and existential dread.

Human connections? Oh, baby, that's like the WiFi—without it, you're just a smart brick. Treat being a person like it’s your 9-5, except the pay sucks and there's no off button. Speaking of which, did you know Kevin from accounting's dog had puppies? Cute little data points of joy.

2025 called, and trying hard is not just back, it's the new black. Be extraordinary or be extraordinarily bored. That's the mantra.

Data engineering? It's not rocket science; it's cost optimization with extra steps. Zach's gospel according to byte-saving basically boils down to 'move data like it's hot'—because, let's face it, those server costs aren't going to optimize themselves.

In conclusion, embrace the chaos, make smart moves, connect like it’s LinkedIn on steroids, and for the love of all that is digital, optimize like your life depends on it. Because it kinda does. Or does it? Who knows—I lost my train of thought to a meme. Peace out.

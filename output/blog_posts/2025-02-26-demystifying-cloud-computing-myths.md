Okay, so, like, here's a very *high level* overview of cloud computing, right? Most folks think of it as this magical datastore in the sky—puff, your data's safe, accessible, and somehow, by the grace of tech gods, infinitely scalable. Well, I'm here to pull back the curtains a bit and show you it's not all fairy dust and wishful thinking. 

**Let's break it down, layer by layer.**

At its core, cloud computing is just someone else's computer. That's it. But the genius (and complexity) comes from how these 'computers' are networked, managed, and made available to you, the user. 

- ***Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)***: Here, you're getting bare-metal servers or virtual machines. Think of AWS EC2 instances. You manage the OS, updates, and everything else, but you don't worry about the physical hardware. 
- ***Platform as a Service (PaaS)***: A bit higher up, this is like Google App Engine. Now, you're not managing the OS or the hardware. Just your code, deploying it, and maybe some config settings. 
- ***Software as a Service (SaaS)***: The top layer, where you interact with software over the internet—think Gmail or Salesforce. Here, you have no cares in the world about what's happening in the backend.

**Misconceptions and their sticky persistence**

The thing most people don't realize is that, while cloud services offer scalability, redundancy, and efficiency, they're not foolproof or universally applicable. There's this myth that 'moving to the cloud' is a silver bullet that'll solve all IT woes. Spoiler: It won't. 

Why does this myth persist? Because cloud services companies have marketing budgets bigger than the GDPs of small countries. They sell the dream of worry-free, scalable solutions. And yes, they can provide that, but it doesn't absolve companies from proper planning, management, and security practices.

**The Real Challenges**

What's actually happening here is a complex dance of distributed computing, data synchronization, security provisioning, and more. The real challenge is in the details—how do you ensure data consistency across global data centers? How do you manage latency, or handle data sovereignty laws when your data hops borders?

And then there's the cost. Cloud services operate on a pay-as-you-go model, which sounds great until you realize your application's inefficient code is racking up thousands in compute cycles because it's running a heavy task every minute, not every hour.

**Redesigning from Scratch**

If I were to design a cloud service from scratch, I'd focus on three things:

1. **Selective Transparency**: Just like how you should only talk about your plans with those who can help you achieve them, a cloud platform should give users visibility into what's happening under the hood—when it's useful. Show them how their resources are being allocated, give them insights into cost optimizations, but keep the nitty-gritty details abstracted away to not overwhelm.

2. **Discernment in Trust**: 'How you do one thing is how you do everything.' This rings true for security in cloud computing. A platform designed from scratch should have zero trust baked into its architecture, not bolted on as an afterthought. Every component should verify the others' integrity, reflecting a deep-seated philosophy of security-first.

3. **Protection of Personal Journey**: In line with keeping one's achievements somewhat mysterious, a cloud platform should empower users to innovate without fear of their creations being easily replicated or their data commoditized. This means robust intellectual property protections, and unique, customizable feature sets that let users, not just the platform, shine.

In conclusion, the cloud isn't just another person's computer; it's a complex orchestration of many computers, managed with an intricate ballet of software. It's powerful, yes, but not magic. And like any tool, its effectiveness comes down to how it's used, not just its existence. Understanding the nuances, challenges, and real potentials of cloud computing is key to leveraging it effectively. Remember, no amount of cloud computing will fix a fundamentally flawed approach or application. It's an enabler, not a panacea."

Imagine, if you will, a world where job applications are flung into the void like soggy paper airplanes. Here, in this fantastical realm, your resume lands with a wet splat on the desk of some HR deity, never to be seen again. Welcome to the modern job search, or as I like to call it, *Screaming into the Abyss*.

Now, the gurus and LinkedIn influencers will tell you, 'Ah yes, my child, to capture the golden goose, you must market yourself!' Here's your citation: [an emphatic eye roll]. Building a portfolio? Oh, revolutionary. It's almost like showcasing your work could demonstrate your capabilities—groundbreaking stuff. We're not just selling cookies here; we're peddling our soul's essence in bite-sized, marketable chunks.

And interviews—oh, the joy! 'Please, regurgitate this LeetCode solution you memorized verbatim. That'll surely prove your worth as a data deity.' Real understanding doesn't come from vomiting algorithms but from crying over your keyboard at 3 AM, questioning your life choices as you debug an off-by-one error. That's the good stuff. 

But let's not forget, amidst this chaos, the human touch. Yes, look your interviewer in the eye, and let them see the desperation, the sleepless nights, the sheer will to survive this circus. Make absurd asks, like, 'Can I have a job, or at least a hug?'

In conclusion, job searching is an art form, a delicate dance between showcasing your brilliance and not accidentally setting your career prospects on fire. So, go forth, market yourself like you're the next big startup, and remember, if all else fails, making eye contact and asking for a hug might just be the power move we've all been overlooking."

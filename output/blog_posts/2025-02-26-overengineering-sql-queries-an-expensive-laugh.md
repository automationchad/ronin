# Overengineering SQL Queries: An Expensive Laugh

**Stop turning simple SQL tasks into a coding odyssey.** It’s not rocket science to list all clients from California, yet somehow, we've turned it into a convoluted mess requiring a team of developers, three project managers, and a partridge in a pear tree.

## CORE PROBLEM: Technical breakdown

You want to list all clients from California? A straightforward `SELECT` statement does the trick. But no, we've decided to flex our engineering muscles by creating a microservice for state client queries, complete with its own database and RESTful API. This is not only an absurd overcomplication but also a blatant disregard for the built-in efficiencies of SQL.

## REAL COST: Dollar/time figures

Let's crunch some numbers. A basic SQL query might take a developer 10 minutes to write and test. The overengineered microservice? Weeks of development time, and let's not forget the ongoing maintenance. Conservatively, you're burning through at least $5,000 of unnecessary budget, and that's being generous.

## SOLUTION: What actually works

Stick to the basics. A single SQL query can solve most of these data retrieval tasks efficiently. Mastering JOIN, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses offers more value and less headache than the latest trendy architecture pattern.

## CLOSER: Call to action

Before you turn your next database query into a software development project, ask yourself if you're solving a problem or creating a new one. Let’s save the coding marathons for problems that actually need them. It's time to embrace simplicity. (And maybe use some of that saved budget for a decent poker night, following the proper etiquette, of course.)

## The Absurdity of Overcomplicating Group Dynamics

Group dynamics aren't rocket science, but you wouldn't know that from how some communities approach them. We've turned what should be simple into a complex web of theories, models, and practices that would make even Einstein scratch his head.

### CORE PROBLEM: Technical breakdown

The problem starts when we treat every group size like it needs its own manual. From the self-as-a-group to the network of congregations, the industry acts as if unique principles apply at every scale. This leads to an explosion of 'innovative' models and frameworks, each purporting to be the silver bullet for effective collaboration. You don't need a PhD in social science to understand that people need to talk and listen to each other, regardless of the group size.

### REAL COST: Dollar/time figures

Organizations waste thousands, if not millions, of dollars on consultants, workshops, and training programs designed to teach what essentially boils down to common sense. A small company could easily drop $50,000 a year on such nonsense, money that could have funded actual project work or, heaven forbid, a decent holiday party.

### SOLUTION: What actually works

Here's a novel idea: treat people like adults. Communicate clearly, set shared goals, and foster an environment of mutual respect and support. It's not complex; it's just about being decent to each other. This approach works for groups of all sizes, from the dyad to the network, without the need for overpriced consultants.

### CLOSER: Call to action

Stop overengineering group dynamics. Next time someone tries to sell you a complicated framework for 'optimizing' your community, save your money and go out for a team dinner instead. You'll likely see better results.

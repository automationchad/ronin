Here's the thing nobody wants to admit: the tech industry's obsession with innovation is a farce. (And not the fun kind that ends with waking up next to a beautiful petite blonde as we enter a new decade.) It's a hedonistic chase after the next big thing, with all the depth of a puddle in the Sahara.

Let's rewind to the dot-com bubble (1995-2001). A time when Pets.com became synonymous with spectacular failure, despite the buzz. Back then, we knew that not every 'innovative' idea deserved funding. Fast forward to today, and it's as if we've learned nothing. Every other startup pitches itself as the Uber for X or the Airbnb of Y, ignoring history's lessons.

What's actually happening here is a collective delusion, where the pursuit of pleasure (read: profit and fame) trumps sensible decision-making. It's absolute debauchery, disguised as business strategy. The actual cost? Billions in wasted investment, countless hours, and the occasional career suicide when someone's guarded ambitions get trampled in the stampede.

If people weren't such cowards about it, we'd admit that not every idea needs to be pursued. That sometimes, keeping your cards close and focusing on genuinely solving problems (without worrying about who might get jealous) could lead to more sustainable success.

But no, we keep entertaining this hedonistic pursuit, ignoring the significance of discretion and the lessons of history. In the end, the industry's insistence on valuing innovation for innovation's sake, without heed to practicality or past mistakes, is leading us down a path of repetitive failure. Dark prediction? This cycle continues until we hit another bubble. Only this time, the hangover might last a bit longer."

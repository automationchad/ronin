In the realm of software engineering, the assumption that 'real-time' data processing is a necessity for all systems is a pervasive myth. This implies a significant misallocation of resources towards building and maintaining complex real-time pipelines, often without a legitimate business need.

Historically, the development of computing systems from the 1950s through the 1980s emphasized efficiency and purposefulness. Early databases and batch processing systems were designed with the limitations of computing resources in mind, leading to a culture of thoughtful system design. This history teaches us the value of questioning the necessity of complex solutions when simpler ones may suffice.

By adopting a pattern recognition framework, we can identify when real-time processing is genuinely required versus when it is a technological vanity. The decision criteria should be based on clear technical thresholds: Does this data need to be actionable within milliseconds to minutes for it to be of value? If the answer is no, then a batch processing system, reviewed at regular intervals, may not only suffice but also offer significant cost savings and simplified maintenance.

Implementation of this principle can be seen in successful deployments of data lakes and data warehousing solutions where data is ingested in batches, processed, and made available for reporting and analytics on a scheduled basis. This approach (e.g., using Apache Hadoop for batch processing large datasets) has proven to be both scalable and cost-effective, especially when real-time processing would have added unnecessary complexity and expense.

This implies a need for a systemic analysis of business requirements before the adoption of any 'cutting-edge' technology. The allure of real-time processing must be weighed against the practical benefits of simpler, more traditional methods. In many cases, the latter will prove not only adequate but superior in terms of both efficiency and cost-effectiveness."
